## Introduction

The idea behind this app is an attempt to, initially, help teenagers that are going through cancer treatment. They already have a lot going on without the worry of their treatment and all the information thats needed to keep that moving smoothly.

The app will alllow them to have one central and personal place to have that information to hand, their mobile device. Key features of the app will be...

* Profile, that contains common information, blood types, next of kin, etc
* Calendar to keep a track of appointments
* Document scanning and storing (locally and securely)
* Ability to group information so that its easy to find, e.g. "tagging" documents
* Symptons Review
* News & Events, feeds for information that is relevant, such as [Teenage Cancer Trust](https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/)

### Technologies

Its been decided that this application will be developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) as it needs to be cross platform, both Android and iOS. The functionality required by the app is not governed by specific OS features.

#### Security/Privacy

Above everything the privacy of the information captured within the app is of the utmost importance. Whenever data is stored or pictures saved, this must always be in a secure fashion. 

## Future functionality

In addition to the ky features the app would be a great place to help with general support

* Personal Journal
* Interaction with fellow patients, to share common experiences
* Fund raising
* Photo Journal
